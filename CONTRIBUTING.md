# Contributing

 Thank you for your interest in this project! We want to encourage individuals and organisations to be involved in its ongoing development as users and contributors. The repo follows the recommendations for contributing originally developed as part of the [Sony nmos-cpp](https://github.com/sony/nmos-cpp) repo.

## Issues

We welcome bug reports and feature requests for the implementation. These should be submitted as Issues on GitLab:

- [Sign up](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) for GitLab if you haven't already done so.
- Check whether someone has already submitted a similar Issue.
- If necessary, submit a new Issue.

Good bug reports will include a clear title and description, as much relevant information as possible, and preferably a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Pull Requests

You can submit bug fixes, patches and other improvements to the code or documentation for review through a GitLab pull request as follows:

* Fork the repository.
* Make and commit changes.
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork.
* Make sure you understand how the repository licence applies to pull requests (see below).
* Submit a pull request.

Good PRs will include a clear rationale for the patch, and should follow the style of the existing code or documentation in this area.

## Licence Agreement

To make the process of contributing as simple as possible, we do not require contributors to have signed a Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA).

All submissions are made under the terms and conditions of the widely-used Apache License 2.0 with which this repository is [licensed](LICENSE). In brief, it explains that you must be authorised to submit on behalf of the copyright owner and that you simply grant the project's users, maintainers and contributors the same ability to use your submission as the rest of the repository.
